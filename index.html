I declare that the following source code was written by me, or provided
by the instructor for this project. I understand that copying source
code from any other source, providing source code to another student, 
or leaving my code on a public web site constitutes cheating.
I acknowledge that  If I am found in violation of this policy this may result
in a zero grade, a permanent record on file and possibly immediate failure of the class.
 
Reflection (1-2 paragraphs):  I really enjoyed writing this program. I had a difficult time with the ordered and un-ordered lists
as far as the <li> open and </li> closed goes. It gets confusing when you have a few of them in your project. Other than
that I think it was a great starter project to get to understand HTML better. I feel like I could walk someone through 
how to create something similar if they were starting from scratch.

            <h2>My Programming Haiku:</h2>
            <ul class="haiku">
                I write code all day.<br>
                I do not know why it works.<br>
                But hey, it still compiles.
            </ul>
            <p>
                My inspiration for writing this haiku came from a shirt that I own that says just about the same thing as the haiku does. I find it quite funny because as programmers, we all know this is true! ;)

            <h2>My Personal Interests:</h2>
                <p>
                    One of my favorite things to do, especially in the summer is go fly-fishing. This isn't just any type of fly-fishing, this is Japanese style fly-fishing called "Tenkara". It is a 
                    much more simplistic and easy to do. I would say if you are interested in fly-fishing at all, to try Tenkara first. It is very easy to pack and stow away, making it take less time to also 
                    get setup. My favorite river to fish in Utah currently is American Fork canyon. It is a tight spot, but all the more reason to be more stealth!  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another thing I really enjoy doing is taking my dogs to run in this field that not a lot of people know about. It is tucked away in a neighborhood, but completely open and very big. They could run
                    and run all day long if I let them. One of my dogs is a golden retriever and she is a little more on the chunky side, she gets worn out the quickest. My other dog however loves
                    to stalk the permimeter and make sure we are all safe. She is a Great Pyrenese and it definitely shows. I try to take them running at least 2-3 times in the week, but it makes it hard when 
                    it is so cold outside.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The last thing that I enjoy doing, and only in the summer time, is to go camping. Me and my wife bought a tent that actually fits to the bed of my truck, so it keeps us off of the ground and a lot
                    warmer on the cold summer nights in the mountains. We were only able to go a few times last year, but this year I want to try and go almost every weekend! There are so many spots all over Utah to explore.
